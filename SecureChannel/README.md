This folder contains an implementation of a secure facility for client-server communication across the Internet. It has a pseudorandom number generator and uses it to perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Then, it adds/removes padding, encrypts/decrypts, and facilitates secure communication between two ends. However, it does not prevent side-channel attacks.
